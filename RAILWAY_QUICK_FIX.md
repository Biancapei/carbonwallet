## ‚ö° Immediate Steps to Fix Your Deployment

### Step 1: Add Environment Variables in Railway Dashboard

Go to: **Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Variables Tab**

Click **+ New Variable** and add these **ONE BY ONE**:

```
APP_NAME=CarbonWallet
APP_ENV=production
APP_KEY=base64:ZdoWE9EGrVbNIu4bZ3bWWktww0F2UgSv5yi5up/10W8=
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_URL=https://carbonwallet.up.railway.app
DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
DB_DATABASE=/app/database/database.sqlite
SESSION_DRIVER=file
CACHE_STORE=file
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
LOG_CHANNEL=stack
LOG_LEVEL=error
```

**IMPORTANT:** Copy the entire `APP_KEY` including `base64:` prefix!

### Step 2: Commit and Push These Files

```bash
git add Procfile nixpacks.toml RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md RAILWAY_QUICK_FIX.md
git commit -m "Add Railway deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Redeploy in Railway

1. Go to Railway Dashboard
2. Click **Deploy** (if it doesn't auto-deploy)
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for build to complete
4. Check the **Logs** tab for any errors

### Step 4: Check Your Site

## üêõ Still Getting "Page Not Found"?

### Check These Things:

#### 1. **Verify Railway Logs**
In Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Logs, look for:
- ‚úÖ "Server running on..."
- ‚úÖ "Laravel development server started"
- ‚ùå Any PHP errors
- ‚ùå "composer: command not found"
- ‚ùå Migration errors

#### 2. **Verify Environment Variables**
In Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Variables, make sure:
- ‚úÖ `APP_KEY` is set (not empty!)
- ‚úÖ `APP_URL` matches your Railway domain exactly
- ‚úÖ All variables from Step 1 are present

#### 3. **Check Build Logs**
In Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Latest Deployment:
- Click to see detailed build logs
- Look for any errors in:
  - `composer install`
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run build`
  - `php artisan` commands

## üî• Common Errors & Solutions

### Error: "RuntimeException: No application encryption key has been specified"
**Solution:** Make sure `APP_KEY` is set in Railway variables (Step 1)

### Error: "Could not find driver (SQL: PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON)"
**Solution:** Railway might not have SQLite. Try switching to PostgreSQL:
1. In Railway, add **New** ‚Üí **Database** ‚Üí **PostgreSQL**
2. Railway will auto-add database variables
3. Change `DB_CONNECTION=pgsql` in your Railway variables

### Error: "The stream or file ... could not be opened"
**Solution:** Storage permissions issue. Already handled in nixpacks.toml

### Error: "Mix manifest not found"
**Solution:** Vite build failed. Check if `npm run build` completed successfully in logs

## üéØ Alternative: Use PostgreSQL Instead of SQLite

SQLite doesn't persist well on Railway. For production:

### Add PostgreSQL Database:
1. Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project
2. Click **+ New** ‚Üí **Database** ‚Üí **Add PostgreSQL**
3. Railway automatically adds these variables:
   - `DATABASE_URL`
   - `PGHOST`
   - `PGPORT`
   - `PGUSER`
   - `PGPASSWORD`
   - `PGDATABASE`

### Update Your Variables:
Change or add:
```
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=${PGHOST}
DB_PORT=${PGPORT}
DB_DATABASE=${PGDATABASE}
DB_USERNAME=${PGUSER}
DB_PASSWORD=${PGPASSWORD}
```

Railway will automatically run migrations on deploy!
