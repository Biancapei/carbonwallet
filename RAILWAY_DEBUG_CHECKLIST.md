# üîç Railway Debug Checklist - Page Not Found

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Check These First

### 1. Environment Variables in Railway Dashboard

Go to: **Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Variables Tab**

**YOU MUST HAVE THESE - ADD IF MISSING:**

```bash
APP_NAME=CarbonWallet
APP_ENV=production
APP_KEY=base64:ZdoWE9EGrVbNIu4bZ3bWWktww0F2UgSv5yi5up/10W8=
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_URL=https://carbonwallet.up.railway.app
DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
DB_DATABASE=/app/database/database.sqlite
SESSION_DRIVER=file
CACHE_STORE=file
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
LOG_CHANNEL=stack
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

**üö® MOST CRITICAL:** `APP_KEY` - Without this, nothing works!

### 2. Check Railway Logs

**Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Logs Tab**

**Look for these GOOD signs:**
- ‚úÖ `Server running on http://0.0.0.0:XXXX`
- ‚úÖ `Laravel development server started`
- ‚úÖ `INFO  Server running on`
- ‚úÖ `Development Server started`

**Look for these BAD signs:**
- ‚ùå `No application encryption key has been specified`
- ‚ùå `RuntimeException`
- ‚ùå `could not find driver`
- ‚ùå `Class not found`
- ‚ùå `Connection refused`

### 3. Check Build Logs

**Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Latest Deployment ‚Üí View Logs**

**Must complete successfully:**
- ‚úÖ `composer install` - No errors
- ‚úÖ `npm run build` - Completed
- ‚úÖ `php artisan migrate` - Ran (may show no migrations, that's OK)
- ‚úÖ Build status: "Success" or "Deployed"

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Fixes

### Fix #1: Add APP_KEY (MOST COMMON ISSUE)

**In Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Variables:**

1. Click **+ New Variable**
2. Name: `APP_KEY`
3. Value: `base64:ZdoWE9EGrVbNIu4bZ3bWWktww0F2UgSv5yi5up/10W8=`
4. Click **Add**
5. **Redeploy** (Railway should auto-redeploy)

**Wait 3-5 minutes and try again.**

---

### Fix #2: Set APP_DEBUG=true

**In Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Variables:**

1. Find `APP_DEBUG`
2. Change value to: `true`
3. **Redeploy**

This will show you the actual error message instead of "Not Found"

---

### Fix #3: Check if Service is Running

**In Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Logs:**

Search for text: `Server running`

**If you see:** `Server running on http://0.0.0.0:8080`
- ‚úÖ **App is running!** Issue is with routes or configuration

**If you DON'T see this:**
- ‚ùå **App is NOT starting** - Check for error messages above

---

### Fix #4: Verify Domain is Correct

**In Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Settings:**

1. Check "Domains" section
2. Make sure domain is: `carbonwallet.up.railway.app`
3. Status should be: "Active" or "Ready"

**If domain is different or missing:**
1. Click "Generate Domain"
2. Update `APP_URL` variable to match the new domain
3. Redeploy

---

### Fix #5: Try PostgreSQL Instead of SQLite

SQLite might not work well on Railway. Try PostgreSQL:

**In Railway Dashboard:**

1. Click **+ New** ‚Üí **Database** ‚Üí **Add PostgreSQL**
2. Wait for it to provision (30 seconds)
3. Railway automatically adds these variables:
   - `DATABASE_URL`
   - `PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, `PGUSER`, `PGPASSWORD`, `PGDATABASE`

4. **Update Variables:**
   - Delete `DB_DATABASE` variable (or set to empty)
   - Change `DB_CONNECTION` to: `pgsql`
   
5. **Redeploy**
