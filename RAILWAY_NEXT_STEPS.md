# ✅ Variables Added - Next Steps

## Great! You've Added the Variables!

Now we need to:

1. **Add 2 more critical variables**
2. **Wait for Railway to redeploy**
3. **Test the site**

---

## 🔧 Add These 2 More Variables:

### Variable 1: APP_ENV
```
Name: APP_ENV
Value: production
```

### Variable 2: APP_DEBUG (temporarily)
```
Name: APP_DEBUG
Value: true
```

**APP_DEBUG=true** will help us see errors if something is still wrong.

---

## ⏱️ Now Wait for Deployment

**In Railway Dashboard:**

1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. You should see a new deployment starting
3. Wait for it to show "Active" or "Success" (3-5 minutes)

**Watch the Logs:**
1. Click **Logs** tab
2. Look for: `Server running on http://0.0.0.0:XXXX`

---

## 📊 What You Should See in Logs:

**✅ GOOD (App is starting):**
```
Building...
Deploying...
Server running on http://0.0.0.0:8080
Laravel development server started: http://0.0.0.0:8080
```

**❌ BAD (Still has errors):**
```
RuntimeException: ...
Class not found...
Could not find driver...
```

---

## 🧪 Test URLs (After Deployment Completes):

### 1. Health Check
```
https://carbonwallet.up.railway.app/health
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "app": "CarbonWallet",
  "env": "production",
  "url": "https://carbonwallet.up.railway.app",
  "database": "sqlite"
}
```

### 2. Homepage
```
https://carbonwallet.up.railway.app/
```

Should show your CarbonWallet homepage!

### 3. Admin Dashboard
```
https://carbonwallet.up.railway.app/admin
```

Should show the admin dashboard!

---

## ⏰ Timeline:

- **Now:** Railway is redeploying (or will redeploy when you add the 2 variables)
- **In 3-5 minutes:** Deployment should complete
- **Then:** Test the URLs above

---

## 🆘 If You Still See "Not Found":

**Copy and send me:**

1. **Last 20 lines from Railway Logs tab**
2. **The exact error message in your browser**
3. **Deployment status** (Success/Failed/Building?)

---

**In Railway Dashboard → Variables:**

- ✅ APP_NAME
